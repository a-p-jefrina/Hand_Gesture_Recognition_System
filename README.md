# Hand_Gesture_Recognition_System
have developed a hand gesture recognition system that can detect and recognize six critical signs in Indian Sign Language (ISL), enabling individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing to convey their needs in emergency situations. The six signs recognized by our system are: Help, Accident, Lose, Pain, Doctor, and Thief. Our system leverages the power of YOLOv5, a state-of-the-art object detection algorithm, to detect and recognize these signs in real-time. Using bounding boxes and labels, YOLOv5 accurately identifies the hand gestures, ensuring that the system can respond quickly and effectively in emergency situations, achieving a detection accuracy of 98%.
